# laravel-docker
A simple yet effective default setup for Laravel on Docker, based on Alpine Linux.

## Installation

- Clone this project into the root directory of you laravel project: `git clone git@github.com:mace015/laravel-docker.git`.
- Optional: Rename the cloned folder to something more generic, like `docker`: `mv laravel-docker docker`.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify it as you see fit with you project's details: `cd laravel-docker && cp .env.example .env`.
- Build the images: `cd scripts && bash build.sh`.
- Create the docker network, the network name must be the project name + -network, for example: `docker network create example-project-network`.
- Start the containers: `docker-compose up -d`.
- Enter the container: `docker exec -it [project-name]-workspace ash`.
- Do all your normal setup for laravel here, things like `composer install`, `npm i && npm run dev`, `php artisan key:generate`.
- IMPORTANT: make sure the `www-data` user owns the storage directory, from within the container, run: `chown -R www-data storage && chmod -R 775 storage`.

## Usage

#### Start all containers:

`docker-compose up`

#### Start all containers in daemon mode:

`docker-compose up -d`

#### Stop all containers:

`docker-compose stop`

#### Build all images:

`bash scripts/build.sh`

#### List all active containers and their IP's:

`bash scripts/list.sh`

## Local HTTPS
In the event you want HTTPS for your local dev environment, follow these steps:

- First, copy `config/cert/default.conf` to `data/cert/your-domain.conf` (ex: `cp config/cert/default.conf data/cert/example-project.test.conf`).
- Open the file you just copied and replace `[your domain here]` with your domain at the bottom of the file.
- `cd data/cert`.
- Next, generate the certificates with the following command (remember to replace `[your domain here]` with your actual domain ;) ):
```
openssl req -config [your domain here].conf -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout default.key -x509 -days 365 -out default.crt
```
- Import the .crt file into the certificate store of your OS, this is diffrent for every OS (you may need to restart your browser for this change to take effect).
- Start the containers with the following command: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f with-ssl.yml up`

## Note for non-linux users (Mac/Windows)
Since Docker for Mac and Windows runs in a Linux VM in the background, the containers aren't accessible by IP like they are on Linux.
You can solve this problem by exposing the required ports, but this approach causes some inherent limitations.
To circumvent these issues on non-Linux platforms I recommend you use [mace015/nginx-proxy-docker](https://github.com/mace015/nginx-proxy-docker), see that repository for more information.

## FAQ

##### I get a permission denied error on the storage folder.
When starting a new project, the storage folder permissions might be wrong.
Enter the workspace container (`docker exec -it project-name-workspace ash`) and chmod the storage folder: `chmod -R 777 storage`.

##### When trying to start the containers, it complains that the network is missing.
This setup runs the hosted application under its own docker network to prevent collisions and confusion when running more than one application on a host.
The network name is defaulted to the project name from the .env file + '-network' (ex: `example-project-network`).
If the network is missing, create it by running `docker network create [network name here]`.

##### The worker container keeps crashing?
This setup assumes you use Laravel Horizon for your queue setup.
If you have another queue setup, you may change the worker image (`images/worker/Dockerfile`) or completely remove it.
